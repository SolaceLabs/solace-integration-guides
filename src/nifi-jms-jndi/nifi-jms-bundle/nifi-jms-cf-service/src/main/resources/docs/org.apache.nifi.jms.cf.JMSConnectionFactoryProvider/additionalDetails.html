        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This ControllerService serves as a general factory service to serving vendor specific 
            instances of the <i>javax.jms.ConnectionFactory</i>. It does so by allowing user to 
            configure vendor specific properties as well as point to the location of the vendor 
            provided JMS client libraries so the correct implementation of the <i>javax.jms.ConnectionFactory</i>
            can be found, loaded, instantiated and served to the dependent Processors (see PublishJMS, ConsumeJMS).
        </p>
        <p>
            To accommodate variety of JMS vendors and their implementation of the <i>ConnectionFactory</i> 
            this ControllerService exposes only 3 static configuration properties that are common across many implementations 
            of the <i>ConnectionFactory</i>. The rest of the configuration properties are set following 
            <a href="http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/java-ent/jnut/ch06_02.htm">Java Beans</a> convention (see below).
	    </p>
	    <p>
        The 3 static configuration properties are:
        <ul>
  		  <li><b>MQ ConnectionFactory Implementation</b> - A fully qualified name of the JMS ConnectionFactory implementation 
  		         class (i.e., org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory)</li>
          <li><b>MQ Client Libraries path</b> - Path to the directory with additional resources (i.e., JARs, configuration files etc.) to be added 
							to the classpath. Such resources typically represent target MQ client libraries for the ConnectionFactory 
							implementation. It is optional if you are using Apache ActiveMQ since its libraries are distributed with this component.</li>
          <li><b>Broker URI</b> - URI pointing to the network location of the JMS Message broker. For example, 'tcp://myhost:61616' for ActiveMQ or simply 'myhost:1414'.</li>
        </ul>
        The rest of the properties are set as Dynamic Properties following <a href="http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/java-ent/jnut/ch06_02.htm">Java Beans</a> 
        convention where a property name is derived from the <i>set*</i> method of the vendor specific ConnectionFactory's implementation.
        For example, <i>com.ibm.mq.jms.MQConnectionFactory.setChannel(String)</i> would imply 'channel' property and 
        <i>com.ibm.mq.jms.MQConnectionFactory.setTransportType(int)</i> would imply 'transportType' property.
        For the list of available properties please consult vendor provided documentation. Here is an example for 
        <a href="https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.javadoc.doc/WMQJMSClasses/com/ibm/mq/jms/MQQueueConnectionFactory.html">IBM's com.ibm.mq.jms.MQConnectionFactory</a>
