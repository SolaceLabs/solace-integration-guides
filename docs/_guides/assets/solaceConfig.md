The recommended approach for configuring a event broker is using [Solace PubSub+ Manager]({{ site.links-docs-webadmin }}){:target="_top"}, Solace's browser-based administration console packaged with the Solace PubSub+ event broker. This document uses CLI as the reference to remain concise - look for related settings if using Solace PubSub+ Manager.

For more details related to event broker CLI see [Solace-CLI]({{ site.links-docs-cli }}){:target="_top"}. Wherever possible, default values will be used to minimize the required configuration. The CLI commands listed also assume that the CLI user has a Global Access Level set to Admin. For details on CLI access levels please see [User Authentication and Authorization]({{ site.links-docs-user-authenticate-authorize }}){:target="_top"}.
